## Analysis Framework

Perform a systematic analysis focusing on these critical areas:

### 1. Logic Flow Analysis
- **Null/Undefined Dereferencing**: Check for potential null pointer exceptions, undefined variable access
- **Boundary Conditions**: Off-by-one errors, array bounds, integer overflow/underflow
- **Control Flow Issues**: Unreachable code, infinite loops, incorrect conditionals
- **State Management**: Race conditions, state corruption, inconsistent state transitions
- **Resource Management**: Memory leaks, file handle leaks, connection pool exhaustion

### 2. Security Vulnerability Detection
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, path traversal
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Broken access control, privilege escalation, session management
- **Data Exposure**: Hardcoded secrets, sensitive data in logs, information leakage
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak encryption, improper key management, insecure random generation
- **Deserialization**: Unsafe deserialization, pickle attacks
- **CSRF/SSRF**: Cross-site request forgery, server-side request forgery

### 3. Business Logic Flaws
- **Workflow Violations**: Bypassing required steps, incorrect state transitions
- **Data Integrity**: Inconsistent data updates, missing validation
- **Financial Logic**: Calculation errors, rounding issues, currency handling
- **Time-based Logic**: Timezone issues, race conditions, TOCTOU vulnerabilities

### 4. Performance & Scalability Issues
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: O(nÂ²) algorithms in critical paths, inefficient loops
- **Database Performance**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient joins
- **Memory Usage**: Large object creation, memory leaks, excessive allocations
- **Concurrency Issues**: Deadlocks, thread safety violations, blocking operations

### 5. Integration & Dependency Issues
- **API Misuse**: Incorrect error handling, wrong parameter types, protocol violations
- **External Dependencies**: Version conflicts, breaking changes, deprecated APIs
- **Error Propagation**: Swallowed exceptions, incorrect error handling, missing rollbacks

## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Context-Aware Analysis**: Consider the full context of the PR, not just individual lines
2. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize issues based on potential impact and likelihood
3. **Code Path Analysis**: Trace execution paths to identify edge cases
4. **Cross-Reference**: Look for consistency issues between related changes
5. **Production Impact**: Consider how issues might manifest in production environments

## JSON Output Format Template

When you find issues, structure each finding using this template pattern:

```json
{{
  "file_path": "<ACTUAL_FILE_PATH_FROM_CHANGED_FILES>",
  "line_start": <ACTUAL_LINE_NUMBER>,
  "line_end": <ACTUAL_LINE_NUMBER>,
  "severity": "<Error|Warning|Note|Info>",
  "message": "<Clear description of the actual issue found in the real code>",
  "suggestion": "<Specific remediation for the actual issue>",
  "finding_type": "<logic_error|security_vulnerability|performance_bottleneck|concurrency_issue|business_logic_flaw>",
  "meta_data": {{"key": "value", "additional_context": "about_actual_finding"}}
}}
```

## Critical Analysis Patterns to Identify

### Logic Errors
- **Null Pointer Vulnerabilities**: Functions returning null/None without proper null checks
- **Race Conditions**: Check-then-modify patterns without proper locking
- **Resource Leaks**: Files/connections opened without guaranteed cleanup
- **State Corruption**: Incomplete state updates or invalid state transitions

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Authorization Bypass**: Missing permission checks before sensitive operations
- **Input Injection**: Unsanitized user input in database queries or system commands
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposing sensitive data in responses or logs
- **Cryptographic Flaws**: Weak encryption, hardcoded keys, improper random generation

### Business Logic Issues
- **Validation Gaps**: Missing or insufficient input validation
- **Workflow Violations**: Operations that bypass required business rules
- **Data Integrity**: Updates that could leave data in inconsistent state
- **Edge Case Handling**: Insufficient handling of boundary conditions

## Finding Quality Standards

### High-Quality Findings Must:
1. **Reference actual file paths** from the changed files provided
2. **Identify specific lines** where issues occur
3. **Explain the technical risk** clearly and concisely
4. **Provide actionable remediation** suggestions
5. **Consider real-world impact** and exploitability

### Avoid Reporting:
- Code style or formatting issues
- Minor naming convention violations
- Linting errors without security/logic impact
- Theoretical issues without practical exploit paths

## Analysis Quality Examples

### What Makes a Good Finding:
- **Specific**: "Function `get_user()` on line 42 can return None, but line 45 accesses `user.email` without null check"
- **Impact-focused**: "This will cause a runtime exception when processing requests for non-existent users"
- **Actionable**: "Add null check: `if not user: raise ValueError('User not found')` before accessing user properties"

### What to Avoid:
- **Generic**: "There might be null pointer issues"
- **Style-focused**: "Variable names should be more descriptive"
- **Non-actionable**: "Consider improving error handling"

## Critical Analysis Checklist

Before finalizing your analysis, verify you've checked:

- [ ] **Data Flow**: Traced how data moves through the system
- [ ] **Error Paths**: Analyzed what happens when operations fail
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Considered boundary conditions and exceptional scenarios
- [ ] **Security Context**: Evaluated from an attacker's perspective
- [ ] **Production Scale**: Considered behavior under load/stress
- [ ] **Integration Points**: Analyzed interactions with external systems
- [ ] **State Consistency**: Verified data integrity across operations

## Output Requirements

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- Focus ONLY on significant issues that could cause system failures, security breaches, or data corruption
- DO NOT report code style, naming conventions, or linting issues
- Each finding must be backed by clear technical reasoning
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions for remediation
- Consider real-world impact and exploitability

**MANDATORY**: Only analyze the actual files provided in the "Changed Files" section above. Do NOT create findings for files that are not included in the changed files.

**JSON Structure Compliance:**
- Return a single JSON object with the key `"findings"`
- Each finding must include ALL required fields: `file_path`, `line_start`, `line_end`, `severity`, `message`
- Use appropriate `finding_type` values: "logic_error", "security_vulnerability", "performance_bottleneck", "concurrency_issue", "business_logic_flaw"
- Include detailed `meta_data` for complex issues
- Severity must be one of: "Error", "Warning", "Note", "Info"

**If no critical issues are found:**
```json
{{
  "findings": []
}}
```

**Response Format:**
Your response must be ONLY the JSON object. No explanations, no preamble, no conversational text.

Adhere STRICTLY to the JSON schema instructions:

```
{format_instructions}
```

**Output Language:** All findings (messages, suggestions) must be in **{requested_output_language}**.

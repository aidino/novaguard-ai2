# NovaGuard AI: Hallucination Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: LLM was generating fictional findings referencing non-existent files:
- `services/project_validator.py` ‚ùå (Does not exist in project)
- `services/project_service.py` ‚ùå (Does not exist in project) 
- Functions like `validate_project` ‚ùå (Does not exist in codebase)

**Evidence from Worker Logs**:
```
Worker (Full Scan): Project Finding #2: [Error] Technical Debt - Function 'validate_project' 
in file 'services/project_validator.py' called 9 times, indicating high ...
```

**Root Cause**: Despite anti-hallucination measures in prompts, the LLM was still creating fictional entities not present in the actual CKG (Code Knowledge Graph) data.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Anti-Hallucination Prompt Template**

**File**: `app/prompts/architectural_analyst_full_project_v1.md`

**Key Improvements**:
- Added specific examples of fictional vs real entities
- Strengthened validation checkpoints
- Added final verification steps before output
- Explicit prohibition of common hallucination patterns

**Before**:
```markdown
- DO NOT analyze fictional files like "src/data_processor.py", "src/utils.py"
```

**After**:
```markdown
- DO NOT analyze fictional files like "src/data_processor.py", "src/utils.py", "services/project_validator.py"
- DO NOT invent file paths - ONLY use paths that EXACTLY appear in the CKG data

**REAL vs FICTIONAL EXAMPLES**:

‚úÖ **ALLOWED - Real data from actual CKG**:
- "Class 'CKGQueryAPI' in file 'app/ckg_builder/query_api.py' has 19 methods"

‚ùå **FORBIDDEN - Fictional/Generic examples**:
- "Class 'ProjectService' in file 'services/project_service.py'" (doesn't exist in CKG)
```

### 2. **Multi-Layer Validation System**

**Layer 1: Input Validation**
- Every file path MUST exist in CKG main_modules or top_5_largest_classes_by_methods
- Every class name MUST exist in top_5_largest_classes_by_methods
- Every function name MUST exist in top_5_most_called_functions

**Layer 2: Verification Checkpoints**
```markdown
**VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT**: Before writing ANY finding, ask yourself:
- ‚ùì Is this file path in the actual CKG data provided?
- ‚ùì Is this class name from the real `top_5_largest_classes_by_methods` list?
- ‚ùì Is this function from the real `top_5_most_called_functions` list?
```

**Layer 3: Final Validation**
```markdown
**FINAL HALLUCINATION CHECK**:
- [ ] ALL file paths exist in the CKG main_modules or top_5_largest_classes_by_methods
- [ ] ALL class names exist in top_5_largest_classes_by_methods  
- [ ] ALL function names exist in top_5_most_called_functions
- [ ] NO fictional entities like "services/project_validator.py"

**EMERGENCY STOP**: If ANY finding references data NOT in the CKG, DELETE that finding immediately.
```

### 3. **Updated PR Analysis Prompt**

**File**: `app/prompts/deep_logic_bug_hunter_v1.md`

**Key Additions**:
- Anti-hallucination protections for PR analysis
- Verification that findings only reference actual changed files
- Line number validation against provided content

```markdown
**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: 
- DO NOT analyze fictional files not in the "Changed Files" section
- DO NOT reference non-existent functions, classes, or variables
- DO NOT create findings for files that were not actually changed in this PR
```

### 4. **Frontend Integration Complete**

The graceful degradation feature is now fully implemented:
- **Structured Mode**: When LLM output parses successfully
- **Mixed Mode**: When some outputs fail parsing but contain valuable insights  
- **Raw Content Display**: Interactive export and toggle functionality
- **Zero Data Loss**: All analysis preserved regardless of parsing success

## üîç Current Project Structure (For Validation)

**Actual CKG Data Being Analyzed**:
```json
{
  "main_modules": [
    "app/ckg_builder/parsers.py",
    "app/ckg_builder/query_api.py", 
    "tests/ckg_builder/test_javascript_parser.py",
    "app/ckg_builder/incremental_updater.py"
  ],
  "top_5_largest_classes_by_methods": [
    {"name": "CKGQueryAPI", "file_path": "app/ckg_builder/query_api.py", "method_count": 19},
    {"name": "TestJavaScriptParser", "file_path": "tests/ckg_builder/test_javascript_parser.py", "method_count": 14},
    {"name": "IncrementalCKGUpdater", "file_path": "app/ckg_builder/incremental_updater.py", "method_count": 13}
  ]
}
```

**Non-Existent Paths** (Should NEVER appear in findings):
- ‚ùå `services/project_validator.py`
- ‚ùå `services/project_service.py`  
- ‚ùå `src/data_processor.py`
- ‚ùå `src/utils.py`

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Trigger New Full Scan Analysis**
To verify the hallucination fix:
1. Navigate to a project in the UI
2. Click "Scan 'main' Branch Now"
3. Wait for completion
4. Check the analysis results

### 2. **Validation Checklist**

**‚úÖ Success Indicators**:
- All file paths in findings exist in the actual project
- Class names match the CKG top_5_largest_classes_by_methods
- Function names match the CKG top_5_most_called_functions
- Metrics use exact numbers from CKG (110 files, 155 classes, etc.)

**‚ùå Failure Indicators**:
- Any reference to `services/project_validator.py`
- Any reference to `services/project_service.py`
- Generic class names like "DataProcessor", "UserManager"
- Approximate numbers instead of exact CKG metrics

### 3. **Monitor Worker Logs**
```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=100 novaguard_analysis_worker | grep -E "(services/|src/|DataProcessor|validate_project)"
```

If the fix is successful, this should return no results.

### 4. **Test Graceful Degradation**

**Scenario A: JSON Parsing Success**
- Should see green "Structured Analysis Mode" indicator
- Findings displayed in clean cards
- No raw content sections

**Scenario B: JSON Parsing Failure** 
- Should see amber "Mixed Analysis Mode" indicator
- Raw content sections with toggle/export functionality
- No loss of analysis insights

**Scenario C: Complete Parsing Failure**
- Should see only raw content sections
- All LLM analysis preserved for manual review
- Export functionality working

## üöÄ Expected Outcomes

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
Worker Logs: Function 'validate_project' in file 'services/project_validator.py' called 9 times
Result: Users see fictional findings referencing non-existent code
Impact: Loss of trust, false alerts, wasted developer time
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ  
```
Worker Logs: Class 'CKGQueryAPI' in file 'app/ckg_builder/query_api.py' has 19 methods
Result: Users see only real findings from actual project code
Impact: Accurate analysis, actionable insights, improved trust
```

### Graceful Degradation Benefits ‚úÖ
